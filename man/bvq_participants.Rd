\value{
A data frame (actually, a \link[tibble:tibble]{tibble::tibble}) with all participants
that have participated or are candidates to participate in any of the
versions of BVQ Each row corresponds to a questionnaire response and each
column represents a variable. The output includes the following variables:
\itemize{
\item id: a character string with five digits indicating a participant's identifier in the database from the \href{https://www.upf.edu/web/cbclab}{Laboratori de Recerca en Inf√†ncia} at Universitat Pompeu Fabra. This value is always the same for each participant, so that different responses from the same participant share the same \code{id}.
\item id_bvq: a character string indicating a participant's identifier. This value is always the same for each participant, so that different responses from the same participant share the same \code{id_bvq}.
\item id_exp: a character string indicating a participant's identifier in the context of the particular study in which the participant was tested and invited to fill in the questionnaire. This value is always the same for each participant within the same study, so that different responses from the same participant in the same study share \code{id_exp}. The same participant may have different \code{id_exp} across different studies.
\item code: a character string identifying a single response to the questionnaire. This value is always unique for each response to the questionnaire, even for responses from the same participant.
\item time: a numeric value indicating how many times a given participant has been sent the questionnaire, regardless of whether they completed it or not.
\item date_birth: a date value in \code{yyyy/mm/dd} format indicating participants birth date.
\item age_now: a numeric value indicating the number of months elapsed since participants' birth date until the present day, as indicated by \code{\link[lubridate:now]{lubridate::now()}}.
\item study: a character string indicating the study in which the participant was invited to fill in the questionnaire. Frequently, participants that filled in the questionnaire came to the lab to participant in a study, and were then invited to fill in the questionnaire later. This value indicates what study each participant was tested in before being sent the questionnaire.
\item version: a character string indicating what version of the questionnaire a given participant filled in. Different versions may contain a different subset of items, and the administration instructions might vary slightly (see formr questionnaire templates in the \href{https://github.com/gongcastro/multilex}{GitHub repository}. Also, different versions were designed, implemented, and administrated at different time points (e.g., before/during/after the COVID-related lockdown).
\item randomisation: a character string indicating the specific list of
items a participant was assigned to. Only applies in the case of short
versions of BVQ, such as BL-Short, BL-Short-2 or BL-Lockdown, where the
list of items was partitioned into several versions.
\item date_test: a date value (see lubridate package) in \code{yyyy/mm/dd}
format indicating the date in which the participant was tested in the
associated study, if any.
\item date_sent: a date value (see lubridate
package) in \code{yyyy/mm/dd} format indicating the date in which the
participant was sent the questionnaire.
\item call: a character string indicating the status of the participant's response:
\itemize{
\item \code{"successful"}: participant completed the questionnaire)
\item \code{"sent"}: participant has been sent the email but has not completed it
yet)
\item \code{"pending"}: participant is still to be sent the questionnaire.
\item \code{"reminded"}: a week has elapsed since the participant was sent the questionnaire,
and has been already reminded of it.
\item \code{"stop"}: participant has not completed the questionnaire after
two weeks since they were sent the questionnaire.
